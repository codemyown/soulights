        <ul class="content1">
            <li>
                <b>What is generally the size of a tour group ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Generally the number of guest traveling varies depending on the destination. The average group size
                    for World Tour is between 40 to 47 and Indian tour is between 28 to 56. However, if a particular
                    tour gets an overwhelming response or if it is a special tour like My Fair Lady or Second Innings
                    tour then the group size may go beyond the aforesaid group size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Who would be my co-travelers ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Your co-travelers can be any individual, right from a professional C.A or Doctor to a teacher, a
                    teenager, an artist, a politician, businessman, people of any religion, from any region, any
                    language etc. When you return from your dream holiday, we assure you that there will be additions to
                    your friends list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Will it be possible to extend my stay at a destination ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    You can extend your stay provided you intimate us of such extension at the time of your booking.
                    Additional charges will be applicable. No extensions/alterations can be done when the tour is in
                    progress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Can I avail just a part of the tour ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    It is not advisable to do tours partly as you wont be able to experience your dream destinations
                    completely. Kesari offers you a wide range of products that suit your requirements. Our travel
                    consultants will guide you on the same.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Is the tour itinerary susceptible to last minute changes, as we need to plan our leaves & make
                    necessary arrangements accordingly ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    We do not change the itinerary nor date of the tour, however in case of force majeure events,
                    circumstances force us to change the routing or date of the tour, as the case may be, just for your
                    safety.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Can I incorporate any changes in my travel plan once the booking is done ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Yes, you can modify your booking or travel plan. There may be certain charges for modifications or
                    for cancelling the old booking and making new arrangements. The travel consultants at our offices
                    will assist you for the same.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What are my options in the event that a tour receives less response ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Generally, we operate all the tours that we launch, however in some cases the total number of
                    bookings fall below our prescribed minimum operating capacity, in such cases we give you options and
                    then accommodate or merge your tour with other available tours. You may also opt for our customized
                    packages in such cases, but the services like group games, group activities, meals, tour leader etc
                    may or may not be provided.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Do you provide Leave Travel Certificate?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    We do provide the leave travel certificate, subject to your intimation to us about your requirement
                    at the time of booking the tour itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>If I misplace my passport, what assistance will I be provided ?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Ideally only 1 Tour Leader is assigned to manage the group & since he has to follow the itinerary,
                    the group may have to move ahead to the next destination while you may have to stay back at your
                    current location - additional services will be on chargeable basis! Either we may be able to provide
                    you with assistance - subject to availability & on chargeable basis only - who'll assist you with
                    all the required & necessary formalities like lodging a complaint / FIR at the nearest police
                    station & securing a Landing Certificate from the Indian Embassy of the respective international
                    destination.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>What is an e-ticket?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    An e-ticket is a paperless electronic document with a unique confirmation number that neatly
                    replaces the hassles of a paper ticket. You may request for a copy to be sent to your e-mail id,
                    in-case of International tours - if & when you require e-tickets for buying Forex, for VISA
                    formalities. For outstation guests who have booked Domestic tours & may arrive at the airport before
                    the scheduled time, we may issue an e-ticket copy if requested for - on a case to case basis, under
                    such circumstances, you are requested to not make any changes in it at the airport as it is a group
                    PNR & any changes may create problem for the entire group!</p>

                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Airlines have different airfares both infant and child as per their defined age category. For
                    infant, airfare is 10% of the adult airfare whereas for child, it is 75% of adult fare or at times
                    child fare may be the same as adult fare. For child above 2 years we also provide separate coach
                    seats for the entire tour.</p>

                <b>Why is the World Tour price quoted in Indian Rupees as well as in Foreign currency?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    This is because we incur expenses of the tour in two currencies. Your air tickets, visa,
                    documentation, some part of land arrangements and miscellaneous expenses are done in Indian currency
                    whereas your land arrangements like hotel booking, meals, coach, sightseeing, entrance tickets etc.
                    are done in foreign currency.</p>

                <b>Why is the World Tour price quoted in Indian Rupees as well as in Foreign currency?</b>

                    This is because we incur expenses of the tour in two currencies. Your air tickets, visa,

                <b>Is there any age criteria for discounts? Do children also get discount?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Discounts are applicable for all guests who are or above 2 years of age for both World Tours &
                    Indian tours.</p>

                <b>What is the difference between Child and Infant?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Infant is any guest who is below 2 years of age whereas child is guest who is or above 2 years of
                    age and below 12 years of age.</p>

                <b>Is there any specific reason, why there is a remarkable difference in the price for an Infant & a
                    Child for the World Tours?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    Airlines have different airfares both infant and child as per their defined age category. For
                    infant, airfare is 10% of the adult airfare whereas for child, it is 75% of adult fare or at times
                    child fare may be the same as adult fare. For child above 2 years we also provide separate coach
                    seats for the entire tour.</p>

            <li>
                <b>Why is the World Tour price quoted in Indian Rupees as well as in Foreign currency?</b>
                <p><b>Ans:</b>
                    This is because we incur expenses of the tour in two currencies. Your air tickets, visa,
                    documentation, some part of land arrangements and miscellaneous expenses are done in Indian currency
                    whereas your land arrangements like hotel booking, meals, coach, sightseeing, entrance tickets etc.
                    are done in foreign currency.</p>
